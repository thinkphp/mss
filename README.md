#  The Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem
 
   Given (possibly negative) integers a1, a2, a3, ... , an, find the maximum value of E(k=i,j)a(k). The maximum subsequence
   sum is defined to be 0 if all the integers are negative. For example, given the sequence -2, 11, -4, 13, -5, -2, the
   maximum subsequence is 20: a2, through a4.
